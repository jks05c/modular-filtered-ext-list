mymodule.js does the work for modular-filtered-ext-list.js. It contains the directory reading and filtering function. It also provides any default args and the definition of the function so that it can be called externally.

modular-filtered-ext-list.js prints results of mymodule.js. The function is called with any default arguments it recieves from mymodule.js and provides the missing arguments.
